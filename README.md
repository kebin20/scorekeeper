# scorekeeper
A scorekeeper project from Colt Steele's Web Development Course on uDemy

It is a sample project where you can keep score for a any game that you play with another player. 

It utilises a mix of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It also utilises CSS made from the Bulma CSS framework. 

Part 1:

Created the basic setup for the HTML and JavaScript files. Then, added a basic heading, buttons for Player 1, Player 2 and a reset button,  with corresponding id names to the elements. Created functions for both the Player One and Player Two buttons, where once clicked, the counter will show a number.  

Quick Thoughts: The use of <span> for the counters to update is very useful when you need the counter to activate.
